/*
 * This file was modified by the Microsoft Corporation in 2015 as follows:
 *    Template the function on the output container type.
 *    Escape characters are considered to be part of a quoted token.
 *    The output container is not cleared before tokenizing.
 *    Added quote_preserve argument (same behaviour as delimiters_preserve).
 *    Added saveQuotedEscapes and saveEmptyTokens arguments.

  purpose:  A tokenizer function which provides a very
        customizable way of breaking up strings.

// Function to break up a string into tokens
//
// Parameters:
//-----------
// str = the input string that will be tokenized
// result = the tokens for str
// delimiters = the delimiter characters
// delimiters preserve = same as above, but the delimiter characters
//    will be put into the result as a token
// quote = characters to protect the enclosed characters
// quote preserve = quotes that are added to the token
// esc = characters to protect a single character
//
